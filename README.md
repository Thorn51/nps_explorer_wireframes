# National Parks Explorer

This project was developed as a student in the Thinkful Full-Stack Engineering program.

This is a series of wireframes for the various pages in the application.

This will be an application that takes advantage of the [National Park Service API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/digital/nps-data-api.htm). Users will be able to search by state to discover National Parks in their area. This will connect people to their National Parks and provide users a quick way to access information on outdoor recreation opportunities. The application will allow users to create a profile, rate parks, and comment on their experience at the various locations. This set of features is just a starting place, the MVP, of an application that could build a full social application around outdoor recreation.

## ## Screen Inventory

### Navigation (component)

Each page will have a navigation component, or navigation bar, on top of the page. This will provide convenient navigation to registration, login, and home.

### Home Page

This will be the landing page. It will clearly indicate the purpose of the app and direct users how to use the app. It will consist of a full-page hero with a text box to enter the users state. After the state is entered the page will display cards for parks in the state. When a user clicks on the park card they will be directed to the park page.

### Registration Page

A form page used to sign up for a user account. User accounts will allow users to comment and vote on parks. The registration form will have fields for first name, last name, email (username), password, and an optional field for home state. Additional user functionality will be explored in future iterations.

### Login Page

A form page used to login to the users account. The form will have text inputs for email and password.

### Park Page

The park page will display information on the park. This will include all relevant data from the API. In addition, users will be able to vote and comment on the park.
